# elan2mqtt-helper
- I don't have a better name for this..
- In this repo is just a `.txt` file so you can install [zdar/elan2mqtt](https://github.com/zdar/elan2mqtt) add-on easily.
> I don't recommend installing elan2mqtt this way normally. Install it this way only if you are experiencing error like [this](https://github.com/Danek309044/elan2mqtt-helper/assets/90469284/d7c197b9-4451-4cae-adb6-e2fc2a40cb3c)
## Run this in your Terminal / SSH with Home Assistant:
`apk add python3 && python3 -m ensurepip && pip3 install -r https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Danek309044/elan2mqtt-helper/main/requirements.txt`
## Then:
1. Add the https://github.com/zdar/elan2mqtt repo in the add-on custom repositories.
2. In the add-on menu there will be elan2mqtt add-on shown so just install it.
